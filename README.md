# ABOUT BIENESRAICES

## A project about a hypothetical real estate company that displays information about the company, about the properties, even has a blog, testimonials, a contact page and a articles of available properties. This was mainly constructed to use the advantages that php presents for maintaining and minimizing code.

This project exhibits:

- Use of php to refrain from repeating html code
- Responsive design
- Lots of flexbox and grid
- A different header for the index, that varies with a function in php
- A button for dark mode
- Reading user’s browser preferences to apply (or not) dark mode automatically
- Burger menu (in a phone size screen) with animation
- Minification, optimization and compilation of my code and files (such as pictures and videos) with automated functions in the gulp file
- A kick ass contact form
- Date in footer set with php
- An Admin section to apply the CRUD principles, connected to a DB
- Login-logout for the Admin.

To run this project you need to install NPM - Node Package Manager - via console with the command: ´npm i´ .

Then, you can run all automated tasks with te command: ´gulp dev´ .

NOTES: The design is NOT my own. I just found a nice design and coded it. Didn’t use ANY framework, except normalize.
